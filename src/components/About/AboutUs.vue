      Welcome to the American Classic Car Club (Canterbury) Inc
    </h1>
    <p id="AboutUsContent">
      The club was formed during the 1970’s. It continues to be a strong club of like-minded people of all ages, like-minded in that all of our members have a passion for American Classic Cars.
      <br>
      <br>
      Club members are owners of a very wide range of American Classic Cars ranging from the 1930’s to present day models. The cars range from those that are impeccably restored to those that are a work in progress.
      <br>
      <br>
      A Committee of up to eleven members, led by a Club President are elected by members of the club at the A.G.M. The Committee puts much effort in to organising interesting and varied events. Each month we organise a get together. These events range from car cruises to a picnic area or to a restaurant/ hotel. Some events involve answering questions along the way and prizes at the final destinations.
      <br>
      <br>
      We also visit car collections, car shows, support charity events and events which are of interest to club members.
